Handwriting Detection
The project idea revolved around using MNIST hand-written characters to prepare an efficient model to help the client to recognize characters from images.
To achieve this I used a combination of Machine Learning Algorithms and data mining methods to identify the English alphabetical input letter into its corresponding digital letter.
By using Convolutional Neural Networks for image processing and image recognition, we were able to utilize it as a trainable topology-sensitive hierarchical feature extractor. 
We then trained CRF to model the dependency between the characters.
